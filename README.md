# interfaceBoard
An interface module for monitoring and communication include some enough features and also optional parts.

I choose not expensive parts to make an economic module then connect some other components to upgrade!

STM324103VET6 as Microcontroller and SSD1963 do as LCD TFT Display Driver, I place ESP8266 to communicate by WIFI.
RS485 and CAN also are ready to use, after that it can collect much data to SD Card and EEPROM and Flash memory.

There are Schematic and PCB Designed in Altium Desinger 2018.
